//
//    What was the error message and explain why.
//
//   --> error[E0133]: call to unsafe function is unsafe and requires unsafe function or block
//   --> Read a variable as a volatile is unsafe, it need to be specified in the code
//
//    Digging a bit deeper, why do you think `read_volatile` is declared `unsafe`.
//    (https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/fn.read_volatile.html, for some food for thought )
//
//    --> "read_volatile" creates a copy of the value it have to read. If the copy fail, it will happen a memory conflict between the returned and the source value.
//
//    Commit your answers (bare4_2)
//
// 3. Volatile read/writes are explicit *volatile operations* in Rust, while in C they
//    are declared at type level (i.e., access to varibles declared volatile amounts to
//    volatile reads/and writes).
//
//    Both C and Rust (even more) allows code optimization to re-order operations, as long
//    as data dependencies are preserved.
//
//    Why is it important that ordering of volatile operations are ensured by the compiler?
//
//    --> It allow to avoid memory conflict, to avoid two command to access the same register in case of a read_volatile failure
//
//    Give an example in the above code, where reordering might make things go horribly wrong
//    (hint, accessing a peripheral not being powered...)
//
//    --> Between lines 59 and 60, it could make a read and a write on the same time on the same register if the read_volatile fail
//
//    Without the non-reordering property of `write_volatile/read_volatile` could that happen in theory
//    (argue from the point of data dependencies).
//
//    --> It could happen between two instructions in different threads if those ones make a read and write at the same time on the same register.
